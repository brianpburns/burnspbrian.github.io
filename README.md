_Vibe_ is a mobile app I developed to help users easily discover local happy hours and live events in bars and restaurants across British Columbia. Built using React Native with Node.js and PostgreSQL on the backend, Vibe is available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/vibe-happy-hours-and-more/id6705122593) and on [Google Play]().

One of the key challenges was populating the app with useful data at launch. To offer a comprehensive list of happy hours and events, we initially needed to gather information for over 250 bars and restaurants. Rather than manually entering each happy hour's timings and menu details, I created a web scraping platform integrated with OpenAI to extract relevant information. While not perfect, this approach made the data collection process manageable.

The project is ongoing, with an upcoming business portal that will allow bars and restaurants to self-manage their listings, update menus, and promote events on Vibe. This feature is scheduled to be available to the first wave of businesses by early November.




## The Masters Golf Fantasy

I also developed a web app for a golf pool my friends and I run each year for the Masters Tournament. The app lets users create profiles and select golfers for their teams, with a live leaderboard to track the tournamentâ€™s progress. Built with React for the front end and Node.js with PostgreSQL for the backend, I also created a mobile version as my first React Native project for learning purposes. While the app isn't intended for public release, it served as a great exercise in mobile app development.
